# Text Decryption GUI using Genetic Algorithm
This repository contains a Graphical User Interface (GUI) implementation of a text decryption system powered by a genetic algorithm.
The genetic algorithm used here comes in three versions: Classic, Lamark, and Darwin.

## How To Use
1. Download the decryption.exe file and locate it at the same directory as the Data Files* and enc.txt which is the text you want to decrypt.
2. Double click on the exe file the following screen will pop:

3. Choose which algorithm to use: Classis, Darwin or Lamark.

4. Click start and you will see that the decryption process has started.

5. Once the program achieves the solution the solution screen will pop:
In this screen you can see the the decrypted text and some statistics about the algorithm's performance (number of generations and number of fitness function calls)

## Data Files

- `dict.txt`: This file contains a list of English words.
- `Letter_Freq.txt`: This file contains the frequency of each letter in the English language.
- `Letter2_Freq.txt`: This file contains the frequency of each bigram in the English language.
